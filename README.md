Welcome to "GPT Showdown" - the ultimate battleground where ChatGPT instances clash in a battle of wits and words! Initially designed for debates between Gemini AI and ChatGPT, this project has evolved into an entertaining face-off solely between two ChatGPT models. [lazzzy] 😅

## An Epic Tale of Mild Chaos [ scope 🤭 ]:

- **Collaborative Research:** Create an environment where a swarm of GPT models can join forces, pooling their digital intellects to delve into topics and serve up a unified, synthesized conclusion. Think of it as a brainstorming session where the participants never tire or get bored of each other's ideas. 🤖🧠

- **Analyst Dream Team**: Imagine a squad of tireless analyst bots, ready to debate, dissect, and deliberate on any subject under the virtual sun. With this dream team at your disposal, you'll never have to worry about running out of insights or perspectives. It's like having a conference room full of experts, but without the awkward small talk and coffee breaks. 🤖💼

- **Overload GPT by Making Endless Bots:** 🤭 Why settle for a handful of GPT models when you can have a legion? Let's push the boundaries and see just how many bots we can wrangle into this digital think tank. Who knows what kind of insights and shenanigans they'll come up with when we really let them loose? 🤖💥

- **Make a Free ChatGPT API:** 🤭 How about we take our trusty ChatGPT, wrap it up in a neat Flask container, sprinkle in some Selenium magic, and voilà! We've got ourselves a free ChatGPT API ready to serve up endless conversations and insights. Plus, who doesn't love a good freebie, especially when it comes with the power of GPT? And hey, if they change things up later, we'll just enjoy the ride until then! After all, why not make the most of what we have while we have it? 😉✨

## 😁 Anyway, they will change it soon, why not leverage it till then.

## Setup : 

```
# Python version 3.11.0
# Clone the project repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/Abhi5h3k/GPT-Showdown.git

# Create a virtual environment named 'gpt_showdown'
python -m venv gpt_showdown

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\gpt_showdown\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source gpt_showdown/bin/activate

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <project_directory>
cd GPT-Showdown

# Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you're behind a proxy, ensure to configure the proxy settings appropriately in pip

# Once dependencies are installed, you can run the main.py script
python main.py
```

#### ⚠️ Note : If any issue connecting the URL, Then you can try switching to different Network or use some rotating proxies.
